package task_topology

// here is an example for you to understand what this plugin do.
//
// In the beginning, we have a job with 6 task:
//   ps0, ps1, worker0, worker1, worker2, worker3
//   for simplicity, each task just need 1 cpu.
// and set the task-affinity to:
//   --affinity [[ps, worker]] --anti-affinity [[ps]]
//
// at the OnSessionOpen stage, we try to generate the bucket by affinity:
// 1. sort the task by taskAffinityOrder
//    in this order, the anti-affinity prior to affinity
//    because anti-affinity would generate more bucket
//    task with orders:
//      ps0, ps1, worker0, worker1, worker2, worker3
// 2. generate bucket
//      ps0, there is no bucket, generate bucket 1
//      ps1, has 1 bucket, but has anti-affinity config, generate bucket 2
//      worker0, affinity to all two bucket, choose bucket 1,
//      worker1, affinity to all two bucket, but by resource balancing, choose bucket 2
//      worker2, choose 1
//      worker3, choose 2
//    now, we have bucket
//      b1: ps0, worker0, worker2
//      b2: ps1, worker1, worker3
//
// after bucket generation, the allocate actions would using these functions in order:
//   taskOrderFn, nodeOrderFn, allocateFunc
//
// after taskOrderFn, we will have task with bucket order:
//   ps0, worker0, worker2, ps1, worker1, worker3,
//
// now for nodeOrderFn, suppose that we have 3 node,
//   node1: cpu 2
//   node2: cpu 1
//   node3: cpu 4
//
// the score for nodeOrderFn would mapping to [0, 10], but now just using bucket score for simplicity
// for ps1:
//   name       bucket in node      score
//   node1:     ps0 worker0         2
//   node2:     ps0                 1
//   node3:     ps0 worker0 worker2 3
//
// obviously, ps0 will bind to node3.
// | node1: - | node2: - | node3: ps0 |
//
// for worker1:
//   name           bucket in node      score
//   node1:         worker0 worker2     2
//   node2:         worker0             1
//   node3:  ps0 |  worker0 worker2     3
//
// and then, worker0 will follow the ps0, and bind to node3.
// and the same to worker2.
// | node1: - | node2: - | node3: ps0 worker0 worker2 |
//
// next task, for ps1:
//   name                           bucket in node      score
//   node1:                         ps1 worker1         2
//   node2:                         ps1                 1
//   node3: ps0 worker0 worker2 |   ps1                 0 // because of anti-affinity
//
// so, ps1 will bind to node1.
// | node1: ps1 | node2: - | node3: ps0 worker0 worker2 |
// and worker1 will bind to node1.
// | node1: ps1 worker1 | node2: - | node3: ps0 worker0 worker2 |
//
// for worker3, the node2 and node3 has the same score,
// the choice will affect by other plugin like binpack or leastRequestPriority.
